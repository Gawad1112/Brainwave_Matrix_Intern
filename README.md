## Features
* Detects obfuscated and suspicious domains
* Flags IP-based URLs
* Identifies deceptive subdomain patterns
* Detects typosquatting and known phishing tricks
* Supports blacklist/whitelist matching
* Command-line interface or API integration-ready
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Techniques Used 
* Hueristic Analysis :
  1.Check for IP address in URLs.
  2.Check for Suspicious Symbols in URLs ex: '@'.
  3.Count hyphens and detect wether it's suspicious or not.
  4.Check Url length.
  5.Check for suspicious Top-Level Domains (TLD)s e.g( xyz, top, icu, club).
  6.Check for subdomain spoofing & Trusted Domains imitation.
* Domain age check through the Whois library.
* Check the URl at the google safe browsing to see if it's blacklisted or flagged as suspicous before.
